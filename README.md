# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means Clustering
In this project, we explore customer segmentation in a supermarket mall using an unsupervised machine learning technique known as K-Means Clustering. Customer segmentation is a critical task for businesses, especially in the retail sector, as it allows for targeted marketing and personalized services based on customer characteristics and behaviors.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains basic information about supermarket mall customers, including the following features:

Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Age: The age of the customer.
Gender: The gender of the customer.
Annual Income: The annual income of the customer.
Spending Score: A score assigned to the customer based on their behavior and purchasing data. This score is used to understand customer spending patterns.
Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation based on the provided customer data. Customer segmentation is a technique that involves grouping customers into distinct categories or segments based on similar characteristics or behaviors. This allows businesses to tailor their marketing and services to the specific needs and preferences of each segment.

Key Steps and Analysis
Here are the key steps and analyses performed in this project:

Data Exploration: The project starts with data exploration. We load the dataset and perform various data exploration tasks, such as checking for missing values, summarizing statistics, and visualizing data distributions.

Data Visualization: Data visualization is a crucial step to gain insights into customer characteristics. We create various plots to visualize the distribution of data, such as age groups, spending scores, and annual income. These visualizations help in understanding customer demographics and behaviors.

K-Means Clustering: K-Means Clustering is the core machine learning algorithm used in this project. We apply K-Means to cluster customers into distinct groups. The number of clusters (k) is determined using the "elbow method," which helps in finding the optimal value for k.

Cluster Visualization: After performing K-Means Clustering, we visualize the clusters in the dataset. This step helps in understanding how customers are grouped based on their characteristics.

3D Visualization: For a more advanced understanding of the clusters, we create a 3D visualization, allowing us to explore customer segments in terms of age, annual income, and spending score.

Results
The project concludes with the successful segmentation of customers into different clusters. These clusters can be used for various business purposes, such as targeted marketing, product recommendations, and personalized services. The 3D visualization provides a comprehensive view of how customers are distributed across different segments based on their age, income, and spending behavior.

This project serves as an educational example of how to perform customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques and can be a valuable resource for those interested in understanding customer behavior in retail and similar industries.

How to Run the Code
To run the code and reproduce the results, you need to have Python installed along with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. The dataset used is available as a CSV file named "Mall_Customers.csv." You can simply clone or download this repository, run the provided Python script, and explore the results on your own dataset if desired.
